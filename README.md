# Overview
Battleship is a classic two-player strategy game; in this version of the game, the player plays against a computer. The game is played on a grid, with each player having a set of ships that they must strategically place on the grid. The goal is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.

# How to play
To start the game, each player will place their ships on their own grid. The ships come in different sizes, with some being longer than others. Players must use strategy to decide where to place their ships as they try to anticipate where their opponent might attack.

Once the ships are placed, the players take turns trying to sink each other's ships by calling out a coordinate on the grid. If the opponent has a ship at that coordinate, it is a hit, and the player gets to take another turn. If there is no ship at the coordinate, it is a miss, and the turn passes to the other player.

The game continues until one player sinks all of the other player's ships, at which point they are declared the winner. Battleship is a fun and engaging game that requires strategy and a little bit of luck to win.
